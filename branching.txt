BRANCHING -> working on different part of the repository in the same time

- git branch
- git checkout
- git merge

-> each of branches have its name


-> default branch name is master
-> we might have "feature" branch if we work on some feature

At any given time we focus on one of two or more branches

HEAD - where are we currently, our branch status
if head is pointing on master that means we are working on master branch

we can work on different branches by switching where our HEAD is 

when we are satisfied with both branches, we can MERGE them back together
anything comes back to our unified master branch
